## Building a Custom Alpine Docker Image from Scratch

In Docker, every image is built upon another image known as the **base image**. For example, when you use:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.19
````

you are using **Alpine Linux** as the base image for your new container.

However, even this base image (like `alpine`) itself has a parent image ‚Äî called **`scratch`**.
The `scratch` image is an **empty image**, representing the very starting point of a Docker build. It‚Äôs used when you want to build an image **completely from scratch**, without inheriting anything from an existing distribution.

### üß± What is `scratch`?

`scratch` is a **special reserved Docker image** that serves as the root of all other images.
It has:

* No filesystem
* No shell
* No package manager
* No utilities or libraries

It‚Äôs essentially **empty**, which means you have full control over what goes inside the image.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example: Building an Alpine Image from Scratch

You can build your own minimal Alpine image using the following steps:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch
ADD alpine-minirootfs-3.22.1-x86_64.tar.gz /  # or provide the repo url where the minirootfs files are present
CMD ["/bin/sh"]
```

Then build and tag the image:

```bash
docker build -t custom-alpine:3.22 .
```

![[Pasted image 20251008182047.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251008182107.png]]

Run it:

```bash
docker run -it custom-alpine:3.19
```

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Building from Scratch

1. **Ultra-small image size**

   * No extra layers, no unused packages.
   * Reduces storage, network transfer, and attack surface.

2. **Maximum control**

   * You decide exactly which binaries, libraries, and configurations are included.

3. **Better security**

   * Fewer components mean fewer vulnerabilities.
   * Ideal for minimalistic or production-grade environments.

4. **Faster startup time**

   * Smaller images lead to faster pulls and faster container initialization.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages of Building from Scratch

1. **Complexity in setup**

   * You must manually include all dependencies and configurations (e.g., libc, CA certs).

2. **No package manager**

   * Installing or updating packages isn‚Äôt straightforward ‚Äî everything must be manually added.

3. **Difficult debugging**

   * No shell, `bash`, or utilities like `curl`, `ping`, etc., unless you explicitly add them.

4. **Harder maintenance**

   * Keeping up with security patches and updates requires manual intervention.

### üß© Why Build from Scratch?

You might choose to build from scratch when:

* You need **extremely lightweight** and **optimized** container images (e.g., for microservices, IoT, or serverless workloads).
* You‚Äôre building a **custom base image** for your organization.
* You want to **eliminate all unnecessary dependencies** for security or compliance reasons.
* You‚Äôre working on **static binaries** (e.g., Go, Rust apps) that don‚Äôt need a full OS.

### üöÄ Summary

| Aspect      | Using Base Image (e.g., `alpine`) | Using `scratch`          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Size        | Small (‚âà5MB)                      | Minimal (‚âà1‚Äì2MB or less) |
| Ease of Use | Easy                              | Complex                  |
| Security    | High                              | Highest                  |
| Maintenance | Simple                            | Manual                   |
| Use Case    | General purpose                   | Specialized, static apps |

### üß† Key Takeaway

Building from `scratch` offers **ultimate control and minimalism**, but it comes at the cost of **complexity**.
For most use cases, starting from a small and well-maintained image like `alpine` is sufficient.
However, if your goal is to build a **fully minimal, auditable, and dependency-free image**, starting from `scratch` is the best approach.
