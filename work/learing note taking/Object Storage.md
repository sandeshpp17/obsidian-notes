# What is object storage ? 

If the cloud server available on the internet where you store the unstructured data using multiple methods.

| 1. Highly available and scalable                                          | 1. Not Highly scalable and available                       |     |
| 2. data storage in unstructured manner                                    | 2. there no data structure required while storing the data |     |
| 3. mostly cost effective                                                  | 3. not much cost effective                                 |     |
| 4. less data transfer speed compare to Block storage                      | 4. more data transfer speed.                               |     |
| 5. generally used to store big data like. <br>eg. audio, video and images | 5. used to storing data file and os data                   |     |

# What is Block Storage ? 

Block storage stores data as chunks of raw data in a linear manner (i.e. in a block). These blocks are also of fixed size, which makes it easy and fast to access that data.
