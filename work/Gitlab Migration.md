### Migrating GitLab from Docker Compose to Kubernetes

####  **Objective**

To migrate our organization's GitLab instance from a Docker Compose setup to a Kubernetes-based deployment to improve scalability, availability, and operational efficiency.

---

####  **Current Challenges**

* **Scalability limitations** with Docker Compose
* Manual upgrades and limited automation
* Lack of high availability and resilience
* Limited observability and monitoring

---

####  **Proposed Solution**

* Deploy GitLab using the **official Helm chart** on Kubernetes.
* Use **managed services** where possible (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, S3 for object storage).
* Migrate existing data (repos, configs, pipelines) with minimal downtime.

####  **Key Benefits**

| Benefit           | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**   | Dynamic scaling of services and CI runners  |
| **Reliability**   | Improved uptime through HA and self-healing |
| **Automation**    | Infrastructure as Code with Helm/Kustomize  |
| **Observability** | Built-in monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)    |
| **Security**      | Better isolation, secret management, RBAC   |

####  **Risks & Mitigation**

| Risk                | Mitigation                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Data loss           | Full backups, test restores       |
| Downtime            | Maintenance window, rollback plan |
| Misconfigurations   | Stage environment validation      |
| Team learning curve | Training, phased rollout          |

---

#### **Estimated Timeline**

| Phase                      | Duration |
| -------------------------- | -------- |
| Planning & infra prep      | 1 week   |
| Staging setup & testing    | 1 week   |
| Production migration       | 1â€“2 days |
| Monitoring & stabilization | 1 week   |

---

####  **Recommendation**

Approve a phased migration to Kubernetes, starting with a staging environment, followed by production cutover with a full rollback plan.
